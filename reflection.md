What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had an eaiser time determining what the attributes were for each of the two classes. I was able to come up with the attribute of inventory for the resale shop relativley quickly. I had a more difficult time when it came to developing the methods for the resale shop class. Specifically, I had to go to the tutors for help figuring how to import the computer class into the resale shop file. It was challenging to figure out how the computer class could be manipulated and used in the methods for the resale shop. Advice I would give to people in the future would be to go to the tutors for conceptual help for this assignment.
